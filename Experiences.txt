exp 11 is the spin up state without damage (most important one)
exp 10 is spin up state with damage for half an additional year
exp 12 (in D) is the other half from exp 10 with no damage (to check ini cond for damage)
exp 12 (in no D) is also standard simulation without damage
exp 1 and 2 are damage exprience without damage advection (1 is normal 2 is for cheking initial conditions with additional spin up year)
compute these with input restart 1997
input restart test is there to test code with the spin up state.
experience 3 is damage with advection 
anything with >7x is testing
70 is with line 34 in damage.f90
71 is without line 34 in damage.f90
72 is without line 34, with upwindRK2
73 is tihout line 34, semilag
74 is no damage rk2
75 is no damage semilag
76 is dmg, rk2, wlsor=1.3
77 is dmg, rk2, td=0.5
78 is dmg, rk2, imex=2
79 is dmg, rk2, imex=2, bdf=1

exp 3 is dmg, rk2, imex2, bdf1, wlsor13, 200 NL, 

5 and 6 and 7 used in paper they start from 11 with nexp = 1
exp 5 is no dam, rk2, imex2, bdf1, wlsor13, 200 NL, 2002-01
exp 6 is dam, rk2, imex2, bdf1, wlsor13, 200 NL, 2002-01, gam=1d-2, th = 30 days
exp 7 is dam, rk2, imex2, bdf1, wlsor13, 200 NL, 2002-01, th = 2 days
exp 9 is no dam, rk2, imex2, bdf1, wlsor13, 500 NL, gam=1d-3, 2002-01 (no diff compared to 5)


trying other stuff with nexp in (1-zeta/zeta_max)**(1/nexp)
expno > 8x will be reserved for this purpose. I want to understand why damage = 1 after 1 timestep...
82 is same as 6 with nexp = 2
83 is same as 6 with nexp = 3, th = 30
84 is same as 6 with nexp = 4
85 is same as 6 with nexp = 5, th = 30
87 is same as 6 with nexp = 10
93 is same as 6 with nexp = 3, th = 2
95 is same as 6 with nexp = 5, th = 2

trying other stuff with nexp in 1-(zeta/zeta_max)**(1/nexp)
23 is same as 6 with nexp = 3, th = 30
25 is same as 6 with nexp = 5, th = 30
29 is same as 6 with nexp = 50, th = 30
33 is same as 6 with nexp = 3, th = 2
35 is same as 6 with nexp = 5, th = 2

65 is same as 25 with (optimal dam) + e = 0.7 (rather than 2)
66 is same as 65 with no dam + e = 0.7 (rather than 2)
67 is same as 25 with P*=35000 and e=2
68 is same as 25 with P*=55000 and e=2

trying other stuff with an exponent in P (1-d)^k
44 is same as 6 with nexp = 5, th = 30, k = 0.5
45 is same as 6 with nexp = 5, th = 30, k = 2

99 is random tests for 1 tstep for damage checking
